## Indicates how much this weather effect will affect water parameter
## Negative values mean it will subtract from total

## Indicates how much this weather effect will affect food parameter
## Negative values mean it will subtract from total

## Acceleration of weather effects's rotation value 
## NOTE: THIS IS ACCELERATION PER FRAME FOR A TIMEBEING - SHOULD PROBABLY MULT BY DELTA
